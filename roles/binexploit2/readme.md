# Intermediate BinEx 2 - Control Program Execution

## Overview 

Challenge is to netcat to port running on the box and find the flag by Seg. Faulting the binary and overwritting the variable that sends you into the IF statement. Sending the program between 65 and 257 characters will overflow it, and provide the hex or 'jack' just after overflowing to enter the conditional statement.

SSH is running on port 9002 in an ubuntu 18.04 docker container
